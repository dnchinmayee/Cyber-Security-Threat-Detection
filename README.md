## Severity Levels for cyber security system

The dataset has following features as cve_id,vendor_project,product,vulnerability_name,date_added,short_description,	required_action,due_date,grp,pub_date,cvss,cwe,vector,complexity,severity. This project shows the application of ML supervised algorithms and the use of Bert model to check the **text clssification** task for the **severity** check issues.

**Note**

Due to GPU usage limits I have taken here only 700 records and have shown the Accuracy result.

## Models used here are

Random Forest,Decision tree, Adaboost, SVM,Multi Layer Perceptron, LSTM
